One of my favorite art mediums that I discovered recently is charcoal. Because blending is so easy, I found it a very fun medium to work with, as all I would need are charcoal pencils, kneaded eraser, and a blending stump.

## 2. Oil Pastels

Art I've done with Oil Pastels. Fun fact: the hand drawing was done using only three colors in addition to white and black: <b> red, yellow, and blue. </b>

Just like with Charcoal, I enjoy using Oil Pastels due to how easily I can blend them. It's honestly much more tedious to work with than charcoal, as I only have a limited set of colors and have to find the right colors to mix to achieve the colors I want (especially when I need to color match to a real object). Despite this however, I find this medium to be extremely enjoyable once you roughly get the hang of it.
